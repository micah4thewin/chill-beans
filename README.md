# Chill Beans Website

## Overview

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Chill Beans website. This repository hosts the code for your company's website, which is built and deployed using GitHub Pages. If you end up liking it you will be able to copy this repository to your own Github account and connect it to your own domain name at www.chill-beans.com.

## Preview

A preview of the new website design can be found at [https://micah4thewin.github.io/chill-beans/](https://micah4thewin.github.io/chill-beans/). Please note that this is a work-in-progress and can change rapidly when I push updates.

## About GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website. You can host your site on GitHub's github.io domain or your own custom domain. For more information about GitHub Pages, please visit the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages).

## Social Media

Your companies page at [https://www.facebook.com/getsome.chillbeans](https://www.facebook.com/getsome.chillbeans) is where the original colors and theme is coming from.
